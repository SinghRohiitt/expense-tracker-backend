# PROMPTS_USED.md

This document lists the AI tools used during the development of this project, as requested in the assignment.

## AI Tools Used
- ChatGPT (for reference and review)

## How AI Was Used
AI assistance was used selectively during development for the following purposes:

- Reviewing MongoDB schema design and relationships
- Validating the use of Mongoose middleware and aggregation logic
- Cross-checking API structure and error-handling best practices
- Improving code readability and consistency
- Reviewing documentation structure (README)

## Development Ownership
The overall project structure, implementation flow, logic decisions, and final code organization were done manually.  
AI tools were used as a supporting resource for validation and refinement, not for direct code generation.

## Transparency Note
AI usage was kept within ethical and professional boundaries and aligned with the guidelines provided in the assignment.
